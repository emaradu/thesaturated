          Similar to photography, but instead make the memories last longer.
          Rewind, select a frame, and remember the exact moment in movement.
          Follow and remember each one's face, and hear each one's voice, once
          again. It might make you laugh,
          <br /> it might make you cry. One way or another, we are blessed with
          a one more time wish to live the moment again. Videography is a way
          for me to capture moving objects and people that make me feel some
          sort of emotion. I see something moving, it moves <br /> in such a
          way, I got to save the moment, I got to save the feeling. Wind
          blowing, tree branches swaying, it signifies peace; cars moving
          around, wheels running, where are people going?; raining outside,
          cloud tears touch the ground, we all feel different today.
          <br /> See and hear, feel and think to yourself 'what goes around
          comes around'. Watching movies and documentaries increased my
          curiosity, so I decided to try on my own and learn about the tricks
          behind the displayed scene. Video editing taught me that what we see
          <br />
          in media is nothing like real life. There is a way to enhance a video
          radically and organize footages that make the message easier to
          follow. Whatever we film we can make it better, we can plan what we
          want to happen and capture it.
          <br /> Videography is an interesting way to deliver a message. It can
          be entertaining, educational, comic, or informative. With the help of
          filmmaking <br /> and editing, I can create my story, share my
          emotions, and express my thoughts freely within the movement.
