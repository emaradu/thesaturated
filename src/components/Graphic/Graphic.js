        Designing is a way for me to put my creativity on paper, which in this
        case it is digital graphic design. Using and arranging elements,
        pictures, built and tied together in the making of a shareable message.
        The art of design is a beautiful way to express a significant message
        visually that would attract eyes and emphasize the possibility to
        connect people. For instance, graphic design has a powerful function in
        bringing all people together to certain destinations, virtual
        engagements, and become the confirmation of a sudden change of opinions
        by just looking at a poster/webpage/ad where interests are rising.
        Graphic design has a strong role in people perceiving the information
        they are interacting with; it is highly impressive how visual artistry
        can have such a big impact on each one's personality. I developed my
        passion for design through visually connecting with various artworks
        that were entertaining to me. As a curious art-directed person, I have
        always been asking myself what was the process of the material I had in
        front of me. So far, I have discovered I have a style, a vision that I
        can use for a diversity of purposes. Thankful for all the inspiration I
        had come across, I learned to express myself through the art of design
        and explore the possibility to transform an image into so much more,
        associate it with a large range of things, create a meaningful and
        informative cover, turning a rich paragraph into main
        straight-to-the-point ideas.
