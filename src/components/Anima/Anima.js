          Falling in love with unreal things that I want to become true.
          Dreaming and dreaming and dreaming. Imagining. Write it down and
          create reality out of it. Convert my imagination to animation.
          <br /> Share my ideas on a blank screen that I can modify or add to.
          2D animations bring me nostalgia. This is where everything started,
          this is where we all grew up. The art of imagination helps many people
          to <br />
          share one of their craziest thoughts and stories. And when it is
          transformed into animation and shared with people, it is beautiful. 3D
          animations bring better visual satisfaction, it works in different
          perspectives
          <br /> and space; it blends with real-life similarities. Animation has
          helped me think outside the box and bring an illustration, an image in
          my head, to life. What can it do and what can it offer. With its help,
          I learned
          <br /> more about details, how they change in movement, and how each
          frame requires a long time of work. It is challenging, but the result
          is always worth it. Being capable of thinking so far ahead,
          <br /> it has taken me to a universe with multiple surreal elements
          that I can analyze and express through animation.{" "}
